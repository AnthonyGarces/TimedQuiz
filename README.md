1 question will display at a time followed by 4 potential answers
Selected answers will display a brief Correct! or Wrong after click depending on if the answer is right or not below the answers before changing the question
The program will then present the remaining time along with a form to log the user initials and time remaining to local storage
Lastly it should display the top 5 scores from local storage
